# Logistic-Regression-Model-for-Credit-Risk-Assessment
This project involves the analysis of the South German Credit Data from the University of California, Irvine. The dataset is designed to classify individuals as either good or bad credit risks based on a set of attributes.

## ðŸ“º Project Description
Credit risk assessment is a fundamental process in the financial industry, crucial for evaluating the creditworthiness of individuals, companies, or entities seeking loans or credit agreements. Lenders, banks, financial institutions, and other credit providers rely on accurate assessments to make informed lending decisions. The objective of this GitHub project is to develop, implement, and share a Logistic Regression Model specifically designed for credit risk assessment.

## Dataset Description
The "South German Credit" dataset contains 1000 records representing individuals who applied for loans at a German bank. It includes the outcome of these loan applications, indicating whether they were approved or not. The approval decision is based on the bank's assessment of the applicant's ability to meet their loan repayment obligations.

### Attributes
* 20 variables, including 3 continuous and 17 categorical attributes.
* Personal characteristics of individuals.
* Information about the loans they applied for.
* Customer's history of previous loans.
* A variable named "Credit Risk" (0 = bad, 1 = good) classifying customers as either good or bad payers.

### Purpose
The main objective of this project is to build and evaluate a Logistic Regression model to predict credit risk. This model aims to assist financial institutions and lenders in making informed decisions when evaluating loan applications.

### Project Contents
* Data Exploration: Utilize data analysis and statistics-based practices to gain insights into the South German Credit Data.
* Data Visualization: Create high-level and advanced statistical plots, including visualizations of correlations, outliers, and more.
* Data Curation: Process and cleanse the data to prepare it for modeling.
* Model Development: Build prediction models for credit risk assessment.
* Evaluation: Discuss computational results and assess model performance.
